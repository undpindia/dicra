# Welcome to DiCRA contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! <br>
Before you start, read our Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable. <br>
In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.
## New Contributor guide
Familiarize yourself with the project's goals and objectives. Go through [ReadMe](https://github.com/shubhamcodez/dicra/blob/main/readme.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/shubhamcodez/dicra/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to better understand our expectations of standard and enforcement guidelines. It is important to be respectful and considerate of others when interacting with the project and its community. Make sure to follow the repository's code of conduct to ensure that all interactions are positive and constructive. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to the project's maintainers or other community members for help or guidance. If you have never worked with Github, I would suggest Git for [Beginners](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk) or reading the github [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started). 

#### Technical contributions, 
<ul>
  <li>Install Python and relevant libraries. </li>
  <li>Preferably, set up a virtual environment. Using a virtual environment in Python can help to isolate dependencies, improve reproducibility, and enhance security by allowing you to install and manage packages and dependencies needed for a specific project in a separate location from your global Python environment.</li>
</ul>

## Provide feedback and report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs, take suggestions and feedback. Report bugs, improvement suggestions by opening a new [issue](https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/issues); it's that easy!

## Making Contributions
While direct merges work great as we work with independent python notebooks, it can get messy and violate our standards sometimes. Here are some recommended guidelines, we insist you follow if you are contributing to the repository for the first time.
<ul>
<li>Consider opening an issue to discuss significant changes: <br>
  If you are considering making significant changes to the codebase, it is a good idea to open an issue to discuss your proposed changes before creating a pull request. This will allow you to get feedback and input from the project's maintainers and other contributors, and can help ensure that your changes align with the project's goals and direction.
</li>

<li>Follow coding standards and style guidelines: <br>
  To help ensure that the codebase is consistent and easy to read, make sure to follow the project's coding standards and style guidelines. This may include things like using a specific indentation style, following naming conventions, and commenting your code to make it easier to understand.
</li>

<li>Document new features and functionality: <br>
  If you are adding new features or functionality to the codebase, make sure to document them thoroughly. This can include adding new sections to the documentation, as well as updating existing documentation to reflect the changes. Be sure to include brief comments and descriptions of your code to help other contributors understand how it works and how it fits into the overall project. </li>

</ul>

## Submitting a Pull Request
<ol>
  <li>Include a clear and concise description of changes in the pull request</li>
  <li>Link to relevant issues in the pull request description</li>
  <li>Address comments and suggestions during the review process</li>
  <li>Resolve merge conflicts, if necessary, before the pull request can be merged</li>
</ol>
  Direct merges work fine too, just make sure you have the permission to do it.

## After Your Pull Request is Merged
Congratulations you have successfully contributed to DiCRA.âœ¨ <br>
Your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHub repository once the merge is complete.
