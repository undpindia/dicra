# Approach for Task_2

After downloading the .tiff files from the link provided in the assignment, 
Step 1: I would create a boundary around pixels which have defined as crop area. 
Step 2: Join the .csv file to the LULC we can figure out which latitude and longitude (point) fall in the boundary or not.
Step 3: Create a new field which can store values binary values for points within the boundary and outside it. 
*This should be done dor every tiff file seprately.
** Only the data related to the specific year should be compared to the LULC map of that perticular year.

# Limitations
Due to less processing power of the laptop the code could not run but I have defined the approach I would consider to follow.
