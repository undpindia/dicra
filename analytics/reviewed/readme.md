## Datasets of Interest

- A new, long-term and global dataset of **soil moisture** measurements from space has been released to help us better understand the water cycle and climate, monitor agriculture and manage our water resources. Scientists working under the soil moisture project of ESA’s Climate Change Initiative have harmonised data on soil moisture from different satellites dating back to 1978 to give us a long-term view of global soil moisture, as well as variations and trends in the water cycle. Developed by the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Dutch company VanderSat BV and the Austrian Earth Observation Data Centre, the dataset  is based on 11 satellite sensors, including the one on ESA’s SMOS satellite and ESA’s historical ERS missions. Starting next year, it will be made available in near-real time through the Copernicus Climate Change Service. Scientists worldwide can now download, use and validate the dataset by visiting http://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org/

- Fire is a recurring part of nature. **Wildfires** can be caused by lightning striking a forest canopy or, in a few isolated cases, by lava or hot rocks ejected from erupting volcanoes. Most fires worldwide are started by humans, sometimes accidentally and sometimes on purpose. Not all fires are bad. Fire clears away dead and dying underbrush, which can help restore forest ecosystems to good health. Humans use fire as a tool in slash-and-burn agriculture to speed up the process of breaking down unwanted vegetation into the soil. Humans also use fire to clear away old-growth forests to make room for living spaces, roads, and fields for raising crops and cattle. But not all fires are good. Wildfires can destroy natural resources and human structures. Globally, fire plays a major role in Earth's carbon cycle by releasing carbon into the air, and by consuming trees that would otherwise absorb carbon from the air during photosynthesis. These maps show the locations of actively burning fires around the world, detected by instruments aboard NASA satellite.

- [EM-DAT International Disaster Database](https://public.emdat.be/about) - The main objective of this database is to serve the purposes of humanitarian action at national and international levels. The initiative aims to rationalise decision making for **disaster preparedness**, as well as provide an objective base for vulnerability assessment and priority setting.

- [Indian Soil Datasets](https://www.nrsc.gov.in/readmore_terrestrial_soil?language_content_entity=en) - **Soil properties** (soil depth, soil texture, soil carbon) are important for their key role in supporting ecosystem services, plant growth, water availability and maintaining carbon stocks. Soil depth is defined as the depth (in cm) to a lithic or paralithic contact (USDA Soil Survey Manual). Soil texture in dicates the relative content of particles of various sizes, such as sand, silt and clay in the soil. Texture influences the ease with which soil can be worked, the amount of water and air it holds, and the rate at which water can enter and move through soil.

- [INDIAN REGIONS SOIL IMAGE DATABASE (IRSID): A DATASET FOR CLASSIFICATION OF INDIAN SOILS](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/indian-regions-soil-image-database-irsid-dataset-classification-indian-soils) - The database “Indian Regions Soil Image Database (IRSID)”, represent the Indian soil types. The dataset provides information on the soil for each image. This helps in the development and evaluation of an image analysis algorithm for the classification of soil type. The dataset consists of original color images of the sand, clay, sandy loam, loam, and loam sandy soil types. The images of the soil samples are collected from two different regions in Andhra Pradesh state, India. As the samples collected region is situated near the Godavari basin, most of the soil samples collected are either sand or clay. The samples that are collected in Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh, India are sandy loam and loam soils. The total number of soil samples collected is 16 numbers. The soil images are captured by using an android mobile camera with 48 megapixels ISOCELL GM2 sensor with an f/2.0 aperture lens. The ISOCELL imager providesa broader, clearer viewing experience to mobile device users. Smart Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) technology of ISOCELL can capture the details more accurately in both bright and dark areas, even in high contrast lighting conditions. The collected test samples were tested in the soil mechanics lab by using sieve analysis and hydrometer test to find out the percentage of sand, silt, and clay in each soil sample. By plotting these percentage values on the USDA soil texture triangle, soil texture type can be identified.

- [SoilGrids — global gridded soil information](https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids) - SoilGridsTM (hereafter SoilGrids) is a system for global digital soil mapping that uses state-of-the-art machine learning methods to map the spatial distribution of soil properties across the globe. SoilGrids prediction models are fitted using over 230 000 soil profile observations from the WoSIS database and a series of environmental covariates. Covariates were selected from a pool of over 400 environmental layers from Earth observation derived products and other environmental information including climate, land cover and terrain morphology. The outputs of SoilGrids are global soil property maps at six standard depth intervals (according to the GlobalSoilMap IUSS working group and its specifications) at a spatial resolution of 250 meters. Prediction uncertainty is quantified by the lower and upper limits of a 90% prediction interval. The additional uncertainty layer displayed at soilgrids.org is the ratio between the inter-quantile range and the median. The SoilGrids maps are publicly available under the CC-BY 4.0 License.

This layer includes a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020.

**Class definitions**

1. Water
Areas where water was predominantly present throughout the year; may not cover areas with sporadic or ephemeral water; contains little to no sparse vegetation, no rock outcrop nor built up features like docks; examples: rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans, flooded salt plains.

2. Trees
Any significant clustering of tall (~15-m or higher) dense vegetation, typically with a closed or dense canopy; examples: wooded vegetation,  clusters of dense tall vegetation within savannas, plantations, swamp or mangroves (dense/tall vegetation with ephemeral water or canopy too thick to detect water underneath).

3. Grass
Open areas covered in homogenous grasses with little to no taller vegetation; wild cereals and grasses with no obvious human plotting (i.e., not a plotted field); examples: natural meadows and fields with sparse to no tree cover, open savanna with few to no trees, parks/golf courses/lawns, pastures.

4. Flooded vegetation
Areas of any type of vegetation with obvious intermixing of water throughout a majority of the year; seasonally flooded area that is a mix of grass/shrub/trees/bare ground; examples: flooded mangroves, emergent vegetation, rice paddies and other heavily irrigated and inundated agriculture.

5. Crops
Human planted/plotted cereals, grasses, and crops not at tree height; examples: corn, wheat, soy, fallow plots of structured land.

6. Scrub/shrub
Mix of small clusters of plants or single plants dispersed on a landscape that shows exposed soil or rock; scrub-filled clearings within dense forests that are clearly not taller than trees; examples: moderate to sparse cover of bushes, shrubs and tufts of grass, savannas with very sparse grasses, trees or other plants

7. Built Area
Human made structures; major road and rail networks; large homogenous impervious surfaces including parking structures, office buildings and residential housing; examples: houses, dense villages / towns / cities, paved roads, asphalt.

8. Bare ground
Areas of rock or soil with very sparse to no vegetation for the entire year; large areas of sand and deserts with no to little vegetation; examples: exposed rock or soil, desert and sand dunes, dry salt flats/pans, dried lake beds, mines.

9. Snow/Ice
Large homogenous areas of permanent snow or ice, typically only in mountain areas or highest latitudes; examples: glaciers, permanent snowpack, snow fields.
 
10. Clouds
No land cover information due to persistent cloud cover.
