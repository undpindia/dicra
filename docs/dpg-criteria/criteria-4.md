# Does the license of libraries/dependencies undermine the openness of the project?

All the major tools and libraries used for developing DiCRA are under open source license. So DiCRA has no dependencies in terms of use of software as it is being developed using open source technologies only.

The platform is transferable to any cloud service provider or data center, it has no mandatory dependencies. Rebuilding of code will not be required in case it is moved from the current hosting provider to any other hosting provider. DiCRA has no dependencies in terms of use of software also as it is being developed using  open source technologies only.

We use the Google API for geocoding addresses for location search. This requires the registration of an API key, and even though there are free credits per month available for use, this could become a ‘paid’ service depending on the traffic on the website.  There are alternatives to this such as the OSM Geocoder, but we found for the Area of our interest, the spatial accuracy and match rate for the openly available datasets were not high enough to be integrated in the platform.

For the basemaps, we use the following sources
- https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles
- https://developers.google.com/maps

Even though they are available for free and open use, they do come with limitatuoins on the maximum number of available calls. (please add this). The Open Source alternatives for this are A, and B (give two sources)
