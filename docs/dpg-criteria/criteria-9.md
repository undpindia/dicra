# Does the project do no harm?

DiCRA is an open access, open source, open code digital platform that provides geospatial analytics of data sourced from multiple open data sources and analyzed by multiple data collaborators. The platform uses and generates data analysis on natural resources impacting agriculture (soil, water, land, meteorological conditions etc.) and markets (price fluctuations of agriculture commodities). The meta data standards, data methodology and analytics are transparently shared on the platform for consumption and feedback by stakeholders in agriculture. Given the non-PI nature of data used and generated by the platform, coupled with transparency & accountability mechanisms built into the design, the risk of harm is reduced significantly.  

Additional  steps taken to mitigate risk of data quality and reliability:
1.	The reliability of data models and data analysis generated by the platform are evaluated by reputed Research Labs (Zero Hunger Lab and JADS, Netherlands) that are partners to this platform. 
2.	The data results generated by DiCRA platform are validated by citizen scientists on the ground to ensure reliability and accuracy. 
3.	Moreover, the platform has a use-case section that proactively encourages peer-reviewed models and use cases from a large community of data scientists across the world. 
4.	Majority of the data sets used and generated by the platform are non-PI in nature that are transparently available to the highest possible disaggregated levels through the platform. 
5.	The only PI data captured by the platform is basic information of users who extract data from the platform through simple download or through Open APIs. Minimal PI information such as user name and email ID are the only details captured by the platform. This information is collected to understand user engagement on the platform and for communicating updates on the platform. 
6.	All the PI data is secured through multifactor authentication system. There are no ‘third party’ data transfers of the PI data through this platform.

## 9.a. Data Privacy & Security

The platform uses and generates data analysis on natural resources impacting agriculture (soil, water, land, meteorological conditions etc.), wealth index (of geographies) and markets (price fluctuations of agriculture commodities). Majority of the data sets used and generated by the platform are non-PI in nature that are transparently available to the highest possible disaggregated levels through the DiCRA platform. 
The only PI data captured by the platform is basic information of users who extract data from the platform through simple download or through Open APIs. Minimal PI information such as user name and email ID are the only details captured by the platform. This information is collected to understand user engagement on the platform and for communicating updates on the platform. User statistics – like downloads, API calls, traffic etc., are aggregated and transparently available on DiCRA platform.

The PI data, however minimal, is stored on UNDP’s cloud infrastructure and secured through multifactor authentication system. There are strictly no ‘third party’ data transfers of the PI data through this platform. 

The application vulnerabilities are handled through Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) application security verification standards. This ruleset protects our application from common threats defined in the top-ten OWASP categories. A pre-configured rule set is managed by the Azure WAF service is enabled to protect from common threats as described in the screenshot below.

The application vulnerabilities are handled through Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) application security verification standards. In order to make the application secure, the following security risks are being taken care of: 
- Broken Access Control 
- SQL Injection 
- Insecure Design 
- Security Misconfiguration
- Cross-Site scripting

UNDP has also done User Acceptance Testing for the application.


## 9.b. Inappropriate & Illegal Content

The content on DiCRA platform are data analysis of open datasets, data modelling and use cases related to - natural resources impacting agriculture (soil, water, land, meteorological conditions etc.), wealth index (of geographies) and markets (price fluctuations of agriculture commodities).  The content that is collected and distributed is majorly geospatial in nature so there is limited scope of illegal content such as child abuse or sexual abuse material.

Users contributing to use cases on DiCRA platform make their submissions in the form of text and image data which is moderated and approved on the back end by UNDP administrators. Show screenshot of Use case entry :

UNDP administrators scrutinize the content based on parameters such as: relevance, scientific reliability and accuracy of the content. Content can be published on DiCRA platform only after the scrutiny of the administrator. Hence any inappropriate/abusive content are rejected at the submission stage itself.


## 9.c. Protection from harassment

Directly there is no interaction between users and contributors though the platform. There is only a moderated interaction between the contributors through our GitHub account. All contributors have to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
