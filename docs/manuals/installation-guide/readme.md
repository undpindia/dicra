## Front End Installation

Operating System : Ubuntu

Technology : ReactJS

### Running Web App  using Development Server

Steps:
1.	Clone the github repo containing the frontend app ```git clone https://github.com/undpindia/dicra.git```
2.	Navigate to **web_portal** folder ```cd dicra/src/web_portal```
3.	Unzip **package-lock.zip** ```unzip package-lock.zip```
4.	Create .env file and add REACT_APP_API_KEY=google_map_api_key
5.	Run the command ```npm install``` then it will install the required packages for running the application
6.	After the installation we can able to run the Web application in Development server using the command ```npm start```

### Running Web App Production Build In a web Server(Nginx)

Steps:
1.	Clone the github repo containing the frontend app ```git clone https://github.com/undpindia/dicra.git```
2.	Navigate to **web_portal** folder ```cd dicra/src/web_portal```
3.	Unzip **package-lock.zip** ```unzip package-lock.zip```
4.	Create .env file and add REACT_APP_API_KEY=google_map_api_key
5.	Run the command ```npm install``` then it will install the required packages for running the application.
6.	To create the production build we need to run the command ```npm run build```. After the successful execution of the command it will create a folder called ```build```, it contain all the build files
7.	Upload all the build files to nginx website deployment location
8.	Make changes to the web server configuration

### Running Web App Production Build in Azure Blob

Steps:
1.	Clone the github repo containing the frontend app ```git clone https://github.com/undpindia/dicra.git```
2.	Navigate to **web_portal** folder ```cd dicra/src/web_portal```
3.	Unzip **package-lock.zip** ```unzip package-lock.zip```
4.	Create .env file and add REACT_APP_API_KEY=google_map_api_key
5.	Run the command ```npm install``` then it will install the required packages for running the application
6.	To create the production build we need to run the command ```npm run build```. After the successful execution of the command it will create a folder called ```build```, it contain all the build files
7.	To deploy react production build in Azure we need to create a storage account in Azure
8.	After the successful Deployment of the storage account Goto static website menu and enable static website option and fill index document name as ```index.html``` and leave error document path as empty (its optional). After saving this it will provide us a primary endpoint.

Screenshot of the same is given below. We can use the primary endpoint to test our react production build, deployed in the storage account and same can be done after the completion of step 6.


6.	After the completion of Static website enabling section it will create two containers called ```$logs``` & ```$web```. And we need to upload the build files created in step 3 to ```$web``` container. We can upload Build files to $web container using multiple ways ie., Azure storage explorer, Visual studio extension Azure storage by Microsoft

Steps followed to upload build files to ```$web``` using Azure storage are

- Goto azure storage extension on visual studio code 
- Sign In using Azure credentials
- Expand storage account we have created for web app deployment
- Under the Blob Container menu we can able to see ```$web``` container, right click on that, choose option Deploy to static website via azure storage,  browse the build folder and complete the deployment.

After completing the above steps we can test the deployment using the primary endpoint

7.	Create CDN profile for the front end 
Create cdn profiles on Home->CDN profiles menu. 
after successful deployment of cdn profile, create cdn endpoint at the end point creation menu specify name as any meaningful name . 

origin type : Storage static website 
origin hostname : the hostname generated by the url when completing the first step

WE CAN ADD CUSTOM DOMAIN FOR OUR CDN HERE

8.	Create Web application Firewall Policies (WAF)
Goto home -> Web application Firewall Policies (WAF) menu
Click create button
On the basic tab under the project details section select AzureCDN 
         	Under the Instance details section select Policy mode select Prevention
	Add necessary custom rules under Custom rules tab
     	Finally associate cdn end point at the Association tab and create the WAF policy


## Backend Installation

Operating System: Ubuntu
Technology: Python
Database : PostgreSQL with postgis extension

### Running Backend Server using uvicorn (Development server)

Steps:
1.	Clone Github Repo containing Backend API ```git clone https://github.com/undpindia/dicra.git```
2.	Navigate to **api** folder ```cd dicra/src/api```
3.	Install all required packages using the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4.	Create a file with the name ```config.ini``` inside ```/config/```. The content of the file should be in the given format.

```
[paths]
Temporaryfiles=temporary file path
[azureblob]
Accounturlazure=account url
Containername=azure container name
Filepath=parameter path in blob
Lulcpath=lulc raster path
[boundaries]
Districtboundary=district_boundarypath
[database]
Sqlalchemyurl=postgresql://username:password@host/dbname
[gunicorn]
Accesslogpath=accesslogpath
Errorlogpath=errorlogpath
```
5. 	Change ```sqlalchemy.url``` inside ```alembic.ini```
6.	To run all database migrations run ```alembic upgrade head```. It will create  all the necessary tables
7.	Finally we can run the uvicorn development server using the command ```python main.py```. It will start a uvicorn development server ```http://localhost:5004```
	
### Running Backend server using gunicorn systemmd managed unit service and Caddy

Steps:
1.	Clone Github Repo containing Backend API ```git clone https://github.com/undpindia/dicra.git```
2.	Create conda virtual environment using the command ```conda create -n environmentname python=3```
3.	Activate the conda virtual environment using the command ```conda activate envname```  
4.	Install all the required packages using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5.	Change User, Group, WorkingDirectory, Environment in the  gunicorn.service file from the repo
6.	Create a gunicorn service by running ```sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service```
7.	Register the unit file ```gunicorn.service``` with Systemd by executing the following commands.
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.service
sudo systemctl start gunicorn.service
```

The ```systemctl enable``` command will add our gunicorn service to resume running when the VM reboots.

The ```systemctl start``` command will quickly start the gunicorn service and invokes the ```ExecStart``` command.

To check the status of our gunicorn.service at any point of time, run the following command.
```sudo systemctl status gunicorn.service ```

8.	Install caddy 2 web server
We can install caddy web server using the following command

```
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/caddy/ /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-fury.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y caddy
```

We can check the caddy server status by running 
```systemctl status caddy```

9.	Now we will configure our Caddy 2 Web server to serve the FastAPI app running on port 8000 via a reverse proxy. To do so, lets edit the ```/etc/caddy/Caddyfile``` by running the following command. ```sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile```

Replace the contents of the Caddyfile and it should look like below
```
:80
reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Restart the caddy server by running the following command
```sudo systemctl restart caddy```
