Data in Climate Resilient Agriculture (DiCRA) is a collaborative digital public good
which provides open access to key geospatial datasets pertinent to climate resilient
agriculture. These datasets are curated and validated through collaborative efforts of
hundreds of data scientists and citizen scientists across the world. The pattern
detection and data insights emerging from DiCRA are aimed towards strengthening
evidence-driven policy making for climate resilient food systems. DiCRA is guided by
the digital public good principles of open access, open software, open code, and open
APIs.

The platform is facilitated by Government of Telangana and UNDP, in collaboration with
Zero Huger Lab (Netherlands), JADS (Netherlands), ICRISAT, PJTSAU, and RICH. It is
part of UNDP’s ‘Data for Policy’ initiative supported by Rockefeller Foundation.
