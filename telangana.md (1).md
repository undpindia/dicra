- ### Telangana fire story
Here my story describe the entire view of representation of summarized the number of fires per administrative boundary per year in Telangana.

GADM, the Database of Global Administrative Areas, is a high-resolution database of country administrative areas, with a goal of "all countries, at all levels, at any time period.In dataset we used the GADM_LEVEL_3 in this discribed the india boundaries geometry .


The "geopackage" format is the a very good general spatial data file format (for vector data). It can be read by spatial packages in python and R (with the 'terra' or 'sf' package), and by GIS software such as QGIS and ArcGIS.

A "shapefile" consist of at least four actual files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj). This is an older, but still commonly used format that can used in R, python, and GIS software such as QGIS, ArcGIS, DIVA-GIS, and many other programs.

A "gadm40_IND_3.kmz" file can be opened in Google Earth and i convert it into a csv file .

"GeoJSON .json" files are useful for web mapping with javascript.

In this code first,we take the telanagana datset and visualized and then data cleaning for model building there need to be geometry take as a point link with the data of gadm level 3 were whole india geometry represent.
Merged the databoth to get telangana state related information to get specific view .

Crop Residue Burning in India An Indian Agricultural Research Institute study estimates that in 2008-09, the particulate released by crop residue burning is more than 17 times the total annual particulate pollution in Delhi from all sources—vehicles, industries, garbage burning, etc. Similarly, the total national annual emission for CO2 from crop residue burning is more than 64 times the total annual CO2 pollution emission in Delhi. India is the second-largest producer of rice worldwide. Paddy and wheat cropping are a widespread farming practice in northwestern parts of India; however, the burning of paddy and wheat straw and stubble by farmers after the harvesting season is quite common.

Solve this problem in telangana state we check the probabilty of fire state with ID.
